//Plan: timer for bird intervals, three stages
//during all stages, clicking on bird scares it off. Stage 3, bird eats plants

//Scarecrow upgrade halves bird timer?


//one interval with random chance of bird movement here. Alternatively 4 intervals
//updateShownValues()

function birdUpdate() {
    //insert birds changing
}
